As part of Interdepartmental Day, she will also lead an all-school workshop exploring the concept of collaborating with AI as nonhuman entities, entitled “Dreaming with Nonhumans and AI Workshop.” Participants will delve into their own hallucinations, dreams, and visions as sources of artwork and thought.

HYBRID | AAS Interior Design Exhibition & Roundtable: Oaye AI / 86 Circles,"HYBRID | AAS Interior Design Exhibition & Roundtable: Oaye AI / 86 Circles

Hoerle Lecture Hall, U L105, and on Zoom
63 5th Ave New York NY 10003
Exhibition & Roundtable: Oaye AI / 86 Circles
Set against the landscape of South Dakota, the Oaye AI / 86 Circles exhibition and roundtable explore how Indigenous perspectives shape relationships with technology and the environment. Created by Lakota youth, this expansive photo series blends images of people, cultural artifacts, natural landscapes, and modern technology, using AI to deepen and enhance each visual story. Rooted in the Lakota concept of kinship, the exhibition invites audiences to rethink AI as a meaningful presence within community life. The roundtable discussion will further examine how non-Western communities understand space, exploring the rich connections between culture, technology, and the land.



In Lakota culture, kinship is the central force that connects community members to each other and their environment. It governs daily life and extends beyond humans to include all beings and elements of the natural world. This exhibition examines how the Lakota view community and environment as interconnected spaces, exploring how technology can be invited into this relational network.



The exhibition features insights from:

Suzanne Kite, an Oglala Lakota artist and scholar whose work engages with Lakota epistemology and contemporary technology;

Sadie Red Wing, a Lakota graphic designer known for her focus on Indigenous visual sovereignty and cultural identity;

Robin Dahlberg, a photographer and educator whose work explores resilience and place.

These collaborators bring unique perspectives to the roundtable, offering discussions that bridge Indigenous and design-focused worldviews.",Roundtable,Research Activity,Pod,Wíhaŋble S’a Pod,,Suzanne Kite,,Y2 Q3: Sept-Nov 2024,New York,United States,The New School,,https://event.newschool.edu/aasinteriordesignroundtable,,
Pit Firing at the Museum of Ontario Archeology,"As part of our community outreach, we have developed a partnership with the Museum of Ontario Archeology. The museum is situated on the Lawson Site which has been occupied since time immemorial and helps ensure our POD research activities remain anchored in the land. In developing this relationship, we have access to venues where the community can engage with AbunINT. The Lawson Site could be an important space for future land-based community engagement here in London, ON. At the end of October 2024, we held a Pit Fire at the museum as part of courses taught by POD members (Jackson 2bears and Tanya Doody). Micheal Ziegler and Cassie Packham participated in the pit firing.
